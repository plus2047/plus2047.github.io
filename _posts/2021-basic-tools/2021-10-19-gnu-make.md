## Basic

The base grammer of command `make` just like:

    wanted_file1: depended_file1, dep2,dep3
    <tab>command1
    <tab>command2
    wanted_file2: dep1,dep2
    <tab>command1
    <tab>command2
    all:
    <tab>command...
    clean:
    <tab>command...

It means if you want file1, you need dep1, dep2, dep3. If anyone of it have been changed when make running, command1,command2... will be run to get file1. WARNING: `make` don't know how to generate file1 and it just run the command you write.

Some 'filename' is special. Commands after `all` will be run in any situation because there are no dependence after it. Command after `clean` will be run when you run `make clean`. i.e. perhaps we can see them as normal files.

If you run `make` command, any files without dependence and files whose dependence have been changed will be generate by the commands after it. if you run `make filename`, just the `filename` will be generate.

## Variable

You can use variable in makefile. read it by `$(a)` and define it by `b=$(a)`, in this case the value of `b` will be calculate when you use it. Or define it by `b:=$(b)`, and the value will be calculate immediately.

## Function

You can also use function in makefile. use it just like `$(shell clear)`, it means use 'clear' string as param to run 'shell' function. (this function is a build-in function, which will run command in system
